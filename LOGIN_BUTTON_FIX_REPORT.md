# 🔐 Login Button Fix Report - Bitzomax

## 🔍 Issue Summary
The login button in the Bitzomax website was showing a forbidden entry cursor (🚫) and was not responding to clicks. This was due to null reference errors in the application that prevented the login functionality from working correctly.

## 🐛 Root Causes Identified
1. **Race conditions in authentication state handling**:
   - The app component was trying to access `isLoggedIn` properties before they were properly initialized
   - Authentication state synchronization was not robust enough
   
2. **Null reference errors**:
   - Unsafe template bindings lacking proper null checks
   - Missing defensive checks in authentication related methods

3. **CSS styling issues**:
   - The login button cursor style was not being properly applied

    // Only true if exactly true, not undefined or null
  }
  ```

## 💻 Technical Implementation Details
