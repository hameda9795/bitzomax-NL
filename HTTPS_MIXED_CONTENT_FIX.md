# ✅ HTTPS Mixed Content Fix - Deployment Complete

## 🎉 Successfully Resolved Issues

### 1. **Mixed Content Errors Fixed**
- ❌ **Before**: `Mixed Content: The page at 'https://bitzomax.nl/admin/upload' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure resource 'http://bitzomax.nl/admin/upload/'`
- ✅ **After**: All URLs now use HTTPS consistently

### 2. **SEO Service HTTPS Compliance**
Fixed hardcoded HTTP URLs in the SEO service:
- Changed `url: 'http://localhost:4200'` → `url: 'https://bitzomax.nl'`
- Changed `"url": "http://91.99.49.208"` → `"url": "https://bitzomax.nl"`
- Changed `"embedUrl": "http://91.99.49.208/video/${video.id}"` → `"embedUrl": "https://bitzomax.nl/video/${video.id}"`

### 3. **Authentication Issues Resolved**
The 403 Forbidden errors on admin pages should now be resolved due to:
- Fixed mixed content preventing proper authentication token transmission
- Enhanced authentication service with better session management
- Added global HTTP interceptor for better error handling

## 📂 Files Modified
