# Lazy Loading Video Gallery Implementation

## Overview
This feature implements lazy loading for videos in the Bitzomax application. Instead of loading videos immediately when the page loads, videos are only loaded when a user clicks on them. This improves initial page load performance, reduces bandwidth usage, and provides a better user experience, especially on mobile devices or slower connections.

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes

1. **Home Component**
   - Added `loadingVideoId` to track which video is currently loading
   - Added `isVideoLoading()` method to check if a specific video is loading
   - Modified the `playVideo()` method to show a loading state before playing the video
   - Added a loading spinner overlay that appears when a video is being loaded

2. **Video Detail Component**
   - Added `videoLoading` state to track video loading status
   - Added `onVideoLoadStart()` and `onVideoCanPlay()` event handlers
   - Changed video `preload` attribute to "none" for true lazy loading
   - Added a loading overlay with spinner while the video is being loaded

3. **CSS Changes**
   - Added styling for loading overlays and spinners in both home and video-detail components
   - Ensured loading indicators are visually appealing and match the application's design system

### SEO Considerations
- All existing SEO metadata is preserved
- Cover images are still loaded and indexed by search engines
- Structured video data is still provided for search engines
- Title, description, and other metadata are unchanged

## Performance Benefits
- Reduced initial page load time by not loading video content immediately
- Decreased bandwidth usage for users who don't play videos
- Better perceived performance due to loading indicators
- Improved mobile experience due to reduced initial data transfer

## Deployment
To deploy this feature:

1. Run the deployment script:
   - Windows: `.\deploy-lazy-loading.ps1`
   - Linux/Mac: `./deploy-lazy-loading.sh`

2. Verify the deployment by:
   - Checking that videos are not loaded until clicked
   - Confirming loading spinners appear while videos are loading
   - Testing on different devices and connection speeds

## Future Improvements
- Add video quality selection options
- Implement adaptive bitrate streaming
- Add analytics to track video loading performance
- Consider implementing video prefetching for next likely videos
